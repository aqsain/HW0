I would like to develop an Andriod application since has huge audience, flexibility for customization, easy integration with other services, and fast deployment.
Kotlin is my choice of programming language since its great option for app development, morden features and since I am familiar with Java it'll be easier for me to code.
I am interested in exploring cross platform development to create an app that can reach both Android and iOS users.
